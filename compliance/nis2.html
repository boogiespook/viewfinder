<h3 class='frameworkHeader'>NIS2</h3>
<p>
    The Network and Information Systems Directive 2 (NIS2 Directive) is an updated piece of EU legislation that widens the scope of entities and establishes more stringent cybersecurity requirements for organizations operating critical infrastructure across various sectors. It is an update to the original NIS Directive, aiming to enhance cybersecurity across the European Union by expanding the scope and tightening the rules.
</p>
<p>
    NIS2 is required to be transposed in all EU countries by 17 October  2024. Given the status of Member State implementations, it is possible that many markets will miss this deadline.
