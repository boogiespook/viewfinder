### Description
Viewfinder is a simple web based to tool run a Security Maturity Assessment.
#### Goals
* The primary goal of a Security Maturity Assessment is to understand your security posture by measuring how well it implements, manages, and improves its cybersecurity processes.

* A key objective is to foster resilience â€” enabling the organization to anticipate, withstand, recover, and evolve in response to security incidents.

* It helps prioritise investments in cybersecurity by highlighting the most critical areas needing attention. It can reveal whether existing controls are effective or if additional resources/solutions are necessary to mitigate risks.

### Building

To build the viewfinder application locally you can use Podman or Docker.

Firstly, clone this repo to your local host

``` git clone https://github.com/boogiespook/viewfinder.git ```

The cd to the code directory
``` cd viewfinder ```

You will need to be logged in to the Red Hat Registry (registry.access.redhat.com). 
(this could be optional)

``` podman login registry.access.redhat.com ```

Enter your credentials and you will be able to pull the required images down to build the application.
You can read more about this here: https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication

Followed by 

``` podman build -t viewfinder:latest . ```

Output will look something like this

```

You can verify this by listing the images on your local machine

```podman images```

and you will get an output something like this

``` localhost/viewfinder                    latest      deb31fe831fc  15 minutes ago  928 MB ```

### Running

Once you have the container built you are ready to run the application.

``` podman run -p 8080:8080 localhost/viewfinder ```

If everything is fine you will see a message like this 

``` PHP 8.0.30 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8080) started ```

You can then open a browser and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to open the main page.

### Pre-built image
If you would just like the image, it's available on quay.io:

``` podman pull quay.io/rhn_gps_cjenkins/viewfinder ```
